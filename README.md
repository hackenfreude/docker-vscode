## CREDITS
* [Jess Frazelle](https://github.com/jfrazelle) for [containers on the deskop](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/).

## WHAT DOES THIS DO?
This is a container that runs vscode.

## WHY?
* Impress your friends by running a GUI application in Docker.

## HOW TO RUN IT?
0. Make sure you're on a system running [X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System).
1. Disable X access control (don't do this on a public-facing machine): `$ xhost +`
2. `$ cd` to a path where you want to write some code.
3. ``$ docker run --rm -it -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY hackenfreude/vscode``
4. You should see vscode pop up.
5. Have fun. Write some code. Close vscode when you're done, and ctrl+c to shut down the container. Your files will be in the path on the host where you started.
6. __Reenable X access control:__ `$ xhost -`

## WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
* Docker mounted the host's X socket in the continer as the container's X socket; this allows the container's GUI to pass back up to the host.
* Docker mounted the host's working directory in the container at the same path.

## WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?
Open an [issue](https://github.com/hackenfreude/docker-vscode/issues/new).
